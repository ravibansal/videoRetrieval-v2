# videoRetrieval-v2
Files and its usage
## extract_video_embeddings.py : 
To extract video feature of size [80 4096] for all the videos in a given path and save it into a provided path. (using pre-trained VGG16 model). Download pretrianed npy file from https://mega.nz/#!YU1FWJrA!O1ywiCS2IiOlUCtCpI6HTJOMrneN-Qdv3ywQP5poecM
## extract_sentence_embeddings.py :
To extract sentence feature of size [4800] for all the sentences in a given .txt file and save it into a provided path (as .npy file).
### -- Requirements: <br />
Please follow https://github.com/ryankiros/skip-thoughts to dowload pre-trained skip-thought model. Please keep extract_sentence_embeddings.py python file in the same directory as skipthoughts.py
<br />
### --usage: 
python extract_sentence_embeddings.py <sentence_input_file> <sentence_feature_file.npy>
<br />
## union_video_embeddings.py :
To take union of all the video features generated by extract_video_embeddings.py and create one .npy file of size [num of videos, 80, 4096].
<br />
### --usage:
python union_video_embeddings.py <video_feature_folder> <video_feature_file.npy>
## train_embedding_nn.py :
To train the two branch network with the input as video feature and sentence feature path. It will checkpoint the model for last n timestamps in provided checkpoint directory.
### --usage:
python train_embedding_nn.py \
    --video_feat_path ./vid_feats.npy \
    --sent_feat_path ./sent_feats.npy \
    --save_dir ./checkpoint/
